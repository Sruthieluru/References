1. Compute Engine > Instance schedules.
2. Create new scheduler > Provide details (Name, Region, Time, Frequency, Time zone).

Important Notes to Remember:
1. Region: The region selected in the scheduler must be the same as the region of the VM you want to schedule.
2. Time Zone: Ensure you select India Standard Time (IST) for your time zone to follow the correct schedule for India.
3. VM Start/Stop Time:
   The VM takes approximately 15 minutes to start or stop after the scheduled time.
   Ensure that your schedule accommodates this time buffer.
4. Permissions:
   compute.instances.start
   compute.instances.stop
Ensure the service account associated with the scheduler has these permissions.
5. API: Ensure that the Compute Engine API is enabled for your Google Cloud project. Without this API, the scheduler will not function.
