### Handling `credentials.json` File

- Storing Locally (for Cloud Shell use):  
  The `credentials.json` file is needed only when performing operations in the Cloud Shell. 
  This file contains sensitive authentication data and should not be stored directly in the GitHub repository for security reasons.

- CI/CD Pipeline Use: 
  Instead of storing the `credentials.json` file in the repository, pass it through CI/CD pipeline variables. 
  This can be done securely by storing the file contents as "protected variables" in your CI/CD environment. 
  This approach prevents exposure of sensitive data while allowing it to be used in the pipeline during deployments or other automated tasks.

### Key Considerations:
- Do **not** commit the `credentials.json` file to the repository directly, as it can expose sensitive information.
- Use **CI/CD variables** to securely handle the file and pass it to your pipeline when needed. This method ensures that sensitive data stays protected during automated workflows.
